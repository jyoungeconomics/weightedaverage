# weightedaverage
Multiple ways to calculate the weighted average of a variable for each level of a group variable 
(e.g. weighted average for men, weighted average for women).

This can be done in a loop, a discrete split of the data, the canned function already in R, 
or using weighting vectors. All are demonstrated and can be implemented without much trouble on any real data you have.

If I missed any methods, please let me know, and I will include them.
